### 1505 Energy In Wave Motion
The maximum value of the instantaneous power $P(x, t)$ occurs when the $\sin^2$ function has the value unity:
$$
P_{max} = \sqrt{\mu F} \omega^2 A^2 \quad \bold{(15.24)}
$$
The average value of the $\sin^2$ function, averaged over any whole number of cycles is $\dfrac{1}{2}$. Hence we see from Eq. (15.23) that the average power $P_{av}$ is just one-half the maximum instantaneous power $P_{max}$
$$
P_{av} = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{\mu F} \omega^2 A^2  \quad \bold{(15.25)}
$$

#### Wave intensity
Intensity $I$ is average power per unit area and is usually measured in watts per square meter($W/m^2$).
If waves spread out equally in all directions from a source, the intensity at a distance $r$ from the source is inversely proportional to $r^2$. This result, called the *inverse-square law for intensity*. follows directly from energy conservation. If the power output of the source is $P$, then the average intensity $I_1$ through a sphere with radius $r_1$ and surface are $4\pi r_1^2$ is
$$
I_1 = \frac{P}{4\pi r_1^2}
$$
A similar expression gives the average intensity $I_2$ through a sphere with a different radius $r_2$. If no energy is absorbed between the two spheres, the power $P$ must be the same for both, and
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{P}{4\pi r_1^2} I_1 &=  \frac{P}{4\pi r_2^2} I_2\\
\frac{I_1}{I_2} &= \frac{r_2^2}{r_1^2} & \bold{(15.26)}
\end{aligned}
$$

15.22 A piano wire with mass $3.00$ g and length $80.0\text{ cm}$ is stretched with a tension of $25.0\text{ N}$ . A wave with frequency $120.0\text{ Hz}$ and amplitude 1.6 mm travels along the wire. (a) Calculate the average power carried by the wave. (b) What happens to the average power if the wave amplitude is halved?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu &= \frac{0.003}{0.8} = 0.00375 \text{ kg/m}\\
\omega &= 2\pi \times 120 = 240\pi \text{ rad/s} \\
A &= 1.6 \times 10^{-3} \text{ m} \\
P_{av} &= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\mu F} \omega^2 A^2\\
&=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{0.00375 \times 25} \times (240\pi)^2 \times  (1.6 \times 10^{-3})^2\\
&= 0.22 \text{ W}
\end{aligned}
$$
If the wave amplitude is halved, the average power will be reduced to a quarter of the origin.

15.23 A horizontal wire is stretched with a tension of $94.0 \text{ N}$, and the speed of transverse waves for the wire is $406 \text{ m/s}$. What must the amplitude of a traveling wave of frequency $69.0\text{ Hz}$ be for the average power carried by the wave to be $0.365 \text{ W}$?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{av} &= \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\mu F} \omega^2 A^2\\
\To A &= \sqrt{\frac{2P_{av}}{\omega^2\sqrt{\mu F}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2P_{av}}{\omega^2\sqrt{\frac{F}{v^2} \times F}}} = \sqrt{\frac{2P_{av}v}{\omega^2 F}}\\
&= \sqrt{\frac{2\times 0.365 \times 406}{(2\pi \times 69)^2 \times 94}}\\
&= 0.0041 \text{ m}
\end{aligned}
$$
