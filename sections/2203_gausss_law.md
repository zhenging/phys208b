### 2203 Gauss's Law


#### Exercises
11

22.11 A 6.20 $\mu C$ point charge is at the center of a cube with sides of length 0.500 m. (a) What is the electric flux through one of the six faces of the cube? (b) How would your answer to part (a) change if the sides were 0.250 m long? Explain.
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Phi_E &= \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{q}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{6.2\times 10^{-6}}{6 \times 8.85 \times 10^{-12}}\\
&= 1.17 \times 10^5 N\cdot m^2/C
\end{aligned}
$$
