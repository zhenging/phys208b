23.14 A particle with charge +4.20 nC is in a uniform electric field $\vec{E}$ directed to the left. The charge is released from rest and moves to the left; after it has moved 6.00 cm, its kinetic energy is $+2.20 \times 10^{-6} J$. What are (a) the work done by the electric force, (b) the potential of the starting point with respect to the end point, and (c) the magnitude of $\vec{E}$?

23.18 Two point charges of equal magnitude $Q$ are held a distance $d$ apart. Consider only points on the line passing through both charges. (a) If the two charges have the same sign, find the location of all points (if there are any) at which (i) the potential (relative to infinity) is zero (is the electric field zero at these points?), and (ii) the electric field is zero (is the potential zero at these points?). (b) Repeat part (a) for two point charges having opposite signs.
