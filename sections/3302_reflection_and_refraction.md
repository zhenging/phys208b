#### Exercises
5, 6, 7, 9, 11

33.5 A light beam travels at $1.94 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$ in quartz. The wavelength of the light in quartz is $355 \text{ nm}$. (a) What is the index of refraction of quartz at this wavelength? (b) If this same light travels through air, what is its wavelength there?

33.6 Light of a certain frequency has a wavelength of $526 \text{ nm}$ in water. What is the wavelength of this light in benzene?

33.7 A parallel beam of light in air makes an angle of $47.5 \degree$ with the surface of a glass plate having a refractive index of $1.66$. (a) What is the angle between the reflected part of the beam and the surface of the glass? (b) What is the angle between the refracted beam and the surface of the glass?

33.9 Light traveling in air is incident on the surface of a block of plastic at an angle of $62.7 \degree$ to the normal and is bent so that it makes a $48.1\degree$ angle with the normal in the plastic. Find the speed of light in the plastic.

33.11 As shown in Fig. E33.11, a layer of water covers a slab of material X in a beaker. A ray of light traveling upward follows the path indicated. Using the information on the figure, find (a) the index of refraction of material X and (b) the angle the light makes with the normal in the air.
