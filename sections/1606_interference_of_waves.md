### 1606 Interference of Waves

#### Exercises
34
16.34 Small speakers A and B are driven in phase at $725 \text{ Hz}$  by the same audio oscillator. Both speakers start out $4.50 \text{ m}$ from the listener, but speaker A is slowly moved away (Fig. E16.34).
(a) At what distance d will the sound from the speakers first produce destructive interference at the listener’s location?
(b) If A is moved even farther away than in part (a), at what distance d will the speakers next produce destructive interference at the listener’s location?
(c) After A starts moving away from its original spot, at what distance d will the speakers first produce constructive interference at the listener’s location?
