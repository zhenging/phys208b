### 3504 Interference in the Thin Films

#### Exercises
29

35.29 The walls of a soap bubble have about the same index of refraction as that of plain water, n=1.33. There is air both inside and outside the bubble.
(a) What wavelength (in air) of visible light is most strongly reflected from a point on a soap bubble where its wall is 290 nm thick?
(b) To what color does this correspond (see figure 32.4 and table 32.1 in the textbook)?
(c) What wavelength (in air) of visible light is most strongly reflected from a point on a soap bubble where its wall is 340 nm thick?
(d) To what color does this correspond (see figure 32.4 and table 32.1 in the textbook)?
>Solution
First, for the visible light to be most strongly reflected, constructive interference occurs. Second, 
a. 514 nm, yellow
b. 603 nm, orange
