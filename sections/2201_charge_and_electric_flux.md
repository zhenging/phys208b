### 2201 Charge and Electric Flux

#### Electric Flux and Enclosed Charge

1\. Whether there is a net outward or inward elelctric flux through a closed surface depends on the sign of the enclosed charge.
2\. Charge _outside_ the surface do not give net electrix flux through the flux.
3\. The net electric flux is directly proportional to the net amount of charge enclosed within the surface but is otherwise independent of the size of the closed surface.
