### 2103 Coulomb's Law

**Coulomb's Law**
The magnitude of the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
The magnitude $F$ of the force that each of two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ a distance $r$ apart exerts on each other can be expressed as
$$
\begin{aligned}
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \quad \bold{(21.1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Fundamental Electric Constants
$$
\begin{aligned}
F = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \quad \bold{(21.2)}
\end{aligned}
$$
The constants in Eq. (21.2) are approximately
$$
\begin{aligned}
\epsilon_0 &= 8.854 \times 10^{-12} C^2/N\cdot m^2\\
\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} &= k = 9.0 \times 10^9 N\cdot m^2/C^2
\end{aligned}
$$
The magnitude of the charge of an electron or a proton, denoted by $e$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
e = 1.602176565(35) \times 10^{19} C
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Examples
21.3 Two point charges are located on the x-axis of a coordinate system: $q_1$ = 1.0 nC is at x = + 2.0 cm, and $q_2$ = -3.0 nC is at x = + 4.0 cm. What is the total electric force exerted by $q_1$ and $q_2$ on a charge $q_3$ = 5.0 nC at x = 0?

>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{1 \text{ on } 3} &= \frac{k|q_1q_3|}{r_{13}^2} = 112 \mu N\\
F_{2 \text{ on } 3} &= \frac{k|q_2q_3|}{r_{23}^2}  = 84 \mu N\\
\vec F_{1 \text{ on } 3} &= (-112 \mu N)\hat i\\
\vec F_{2 \text{ on } 3} &= (84 \mu N)\hat i\\
\vec F_3 &= \vec F_{1 \text{ on } 3} + \vec F_{2 \text{ on } 3}\\
&= (-28\mu N)\hat i
\end{aligned}
$$

21.4 Two equal positive charges $q_1 = q_2 = 2.0 \mu C$ are located at x = 0, y = 0.30 m and x = 0, y = -0.30 m, respectively. What are the magnitude and direction of the total electric force that $q_1$ and $q_2$ exert on a third charge $Q = 4.0 \mu C$ at x = 0.40 m, y = 0?

>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
F_{1 \text{ or }2 \text{ On } Q} &= \frac{kq_1 Q}{r^2} = 0.29 \text{ N}
\end{aligned}
$$
The x-components of the two forces are equal:
$$
\begin{aligned}
(F_{1 \text{ or }2 \text{ On } Q} )_x &= F_{1 \text{ or }2 \text{ On } Q} \cos \alpha\\
&= 0.29 \text{ N} \times \frac{0.4 \text{ m}}{0.5 \text{ m}} = 0.23 \text{ N}
\end{aligned}
$$
From symmetry we see that the y-components of the two forces are equal and opposite. Hence their sum is zero and the total force $F$ on Q has only an x-component $F_x$ = 0.23 N + 0.23 N = 0.46 N. The total force on $Q$ is in the +x-direction, with magnitude 0.46 N.
