### 2103 Coulomb's Law

**Coulomb's Law**
The magnitude of the electric force between two point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.
The magnitude $F$ of the force that each of two point charges $q_1$ and $q_2$ a distance $r$ apart exerts on each other can be expressed as
$$
\begin{aligned}
F = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} \quad \bold{(21.1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

21.2 Lightning occurs when there is a flow of electric charge (principally electrons) between the ground and a thundercloud. The maximum rate of charge flow in a lightning bolt is about 20,000 C/s; this lasts for 100 $\mu$s or less. How much charge flows between the ground and the cloud in this time? How many electrons flow during this time?

21.7 An average human weighs about 650 N. If each of two average humans could carry 1.0 C of excess charge, one positive and one negative, how far apart would they have to be for the electric attraction between them to equal their 650-N weight?

21.12 A negative charge of -0.550 $\mu$C exerts an upward 0.600-N force on an unknown charge that is located 0.300 m directly below the first charge. What are (a) the value of the unknown charge (magnitude and sign); (b) the magnitude and direction of the force that the unknown charge exerts on the -0.550 $\mu$C charge?

21.15 In Example 21.3, calculate the net force on charge $q_1$.

21.16 In Example 21.4, what is the net force (magnitude and direction) on charge $q_1$ exerted by the other two charges?

21.17 Three point charges are arranged along the x-axis. Charge $q_1 = +3.00 \mu$C is at the origin, and charge $q_2 = -5.00 \mu$C is at x = 0.200 m. Charge $q_3 = - 8.00 \mu$C. Where is $q_3$ located if the net force on $q_1$ is 7.00 N in the - x-direction ?
