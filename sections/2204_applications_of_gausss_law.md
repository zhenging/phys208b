#### EXAMPLE 22.6 FIELD OF A UNIFORM LINE CHARGE
Electric charge is distributed uniformly along an infinitely long, thin wire. The charge per unit length is l (assumed positive). Find the electric field by using Gauss's law.
![Graph](../assets/2219.png)
The flux through the flat ends of our Gaussian surface is zero because the radial electric field os parallel to these ends, and so $\vec E \cdot \hat n = 0$. On the cylindrical part of our surface we have $\vec E \cdot \hat n = E_\perp = E$ everwhere. If $\lm$ were negative, we would have $\vec E \cdot \hat n = E_\perp = -E$ everwhere. The area of the cylindrical surface is $2\pi rl$, so the flux through it-and hence the total flux $\Phi_E$ through the Gaussian surface -  is $EA = 2\pi rl E$. The total enclosed charge is $Q_{encl} = \lm l$, and so from Gauss's Law, Eq. (22.8)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Phi_E &= EA = 2\pi rl E = \frac{\lm l}{\epsilon_0}\\
\To E &= \frac{1}{2\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{\lm}{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### EXAMPLE 22.7 FIELD OF AN INFINITE PLANE SHEET OF CHARGE
Use Gauss's law to find the electric field caused by a thin, flat, infinite sheet with a uniform positive surface charge density $\sigma$.
![Graph](../assets/2220.png)
>Solution
The flux through the cylindrical part of our Gaussian surface is zero because $\vec E \cdot \hat n = 0$ everywhere. The flux through each flat end of the surface is $+EA$ becaues $\vec E \cdot \hat n = E_\perp = E$ everwhere. If $\lm$ were negative, we would have $\vec E \cdot \hat n = E_\perp = -E$ everwhere, so the total flux through both ends-and hence the total flux $\Phi_E$ through the Gaussian surface -  is $+2EA$. The total enclosed charge is $Q_{encl} = \sigma A$, and so from Gauss's Law, Eq. (22.8)
$$
\begin{aligned}
2EA &= \frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon_0}\\
\To E &= \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}
\end{aligned}
$$

22.17 A very long uniform line of charge has charge per unit length 4.80 $\mu C/m$ and lies along the x-axis. A second long uniform line of charge has charge per unit length -2.40 $\mu C/m$ and is parallel to the x-axis at y = 0.400 m. What is the net electric field (magnitude and direction) at the following points on the y-axis: (a) y = 0.200 m and (b) y = 0.600 m?
>Solution
a. $6.47\times 10^5 N/C$. Positive y-axis direction.
b. $7.2\times 10^4 N/C$. Negative y-axis direction.

22.22 A point charge of -3.00 $\mu C$ is located in the center of a spherical cavity of radius 6.90 cm inside an insulating spherical charged solid. The charge density in the solid is $7.35 × 10^{−4} C/m^3$. Calculate the magnitude of the electric field inside the solid at a distance of 9.30 cm from the center of the cavity.
>Solution
Let the radius of the cavity be $r_1$, and the distance from the Gaussian Surface to the center of the cavity be $r_2$. The charge enclosed by the solid from $r_1$  to $r_2$ is
$$
\begin{aligned}
r_1 &= 0.069 m \quad r_2 = 0.093 m\\
q_2 &= (\frac{4}{3}\pi r_2^3 - \frac{4}{3}\pi r_1^3) \times \rho\\
&= 1.53 \times 10^{-6}C
\end{aligned}
$$
The total charge enclosed by Gaussian Surface is
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_{encl} &= q_1 + q_2\\
&= -3\times 10^{-6} + 1.53 \times 10^{-6}C\\
&= -1.47 \times 10^{-6} C
\end{aligned}
$$
From Gauss's law,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Phi_E = EA &= \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}\\
\To E &= \frac{Q_{encl}}{A\epsilon_0} = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\pi r_2^2 \epsilon_0}\\
&= -1.6 \times 10^6 N/C
\end{aligned}
$$
Since the total enclosed charge is negative, the electric field is radially directed inward.

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_{encl} &= \sigma (2\pi Rl)\\
\Phi_E & = E A = E \cdot 2\pi R l = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}\\
\To & E = \frac{\sigma R}{\epsilon_0 r}
\end{aligned}

22.53 A nonuniform, but spherically symmetric, distribution of charge has a charge density $\rho(r)$ given as follows:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\rho(r) &= \rho_0(1-\frac{r}{R}) & \text{for } r \les R\\
\rho(r) &= 0 & \text{for } r \ges R
\end{aligned}
$$
where $\rho_0 = 3Q/\pi R^3$ is a positive constant.
(a) Show that the total charge contained in the charge distribution is $Q$.
(b) Show that the electric field in the region $r\ges R$ is identical to that produced by a point charge $Q$ at $r = 0$.
(c) Obtain an expression for the electric field in the region $r \les R$.
(d) Graph the electric-field magnitude E as a function of r.
(e) Find the value of $r$ at which the electric field is maximum, and find the value of that maximum field.
>Solution
a. The total charge contained in the distribution is
$$
\begin{aligned}
dq &= \rho dV\\
dq &= \rho_0(1-\frac{r}{R}) \cdot d(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3)\\
&= (\frac{12Qr^2}{R^3} - \frac{12Qr^3}{R^4})dr\\
\int_0^Q dQ &= \int_0^R (\frac{12Qr^2}{R^3} - \frac{12Qr^3}{R^4})dr\\
q &= \big(\frac{4Qr^3}{R^3} - \frac{3Qr^4}{R^4}\big) \big \vert_0^R\\
&= \frac{4QR^3}{R^3} - \frac{3QR^4}{R^4}\\
&= 4Q - 3Q = Q
\end{aligned}
$$
b. When $r \ges R$, the enclosed charge by Gaussian Surface is $Q$. From Gauss's Law,
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Phi_E &= EA = \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0}\\
E &= \frac{Q}{A \epsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2}
\end{aligned}
$$
From Coulomb's Law, the electric field at a distance $r$ from a point charge $Q$ is $E = \frac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^2}$, which is the same with what we have from Gauss's Law.
cde. From part (a), the enclosed charged when $r \les R$ can be calculated as
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_{encl} &= \big(\frac{4Qr^3}{R^3} - \frac{3Qr^4}{R^4}\big) \big \vert_0^r\\
&= \frac{Q}{R^4}(4Rr^3 - 3r^4)\\
E &= \frac{Q_{encl}}{4\pi r^2 \epsilon_0} = \frac{Q}{4R^4\pi \epsilon_0}(4Rr-3r^2)\\
\dfrac{dE}{dr} &= \frac{Q}{4R^4\pi \epsilon_0}(4R-6r) = 0\\
\To &r = \frac{2}{3}R\\
E_{max} &= \frac{Q}{4R^4\pi \epsilon_0}(4R \frac{2R}{3}-3(\frac{2R}{3})^2)\\
&= \frac{Q}{3\pi R^2 \epsilon_0}
\end{aligned}
$$

22.73 A very long conducting tube (hollow cylinder) has inner radius $a$ and outer radius $b$. It carries charge per unit length $− \alpha$ where $\alpha$ is a positive constant with units of C/m. A line of charge lies along the axis of the tube. The line of charge has charge per unit length $\alpha$.
(a) Calculate the magnitude the electric field in terms of $\alpha$ and the distance $r$ from the axis of the tube for $r<a$.
(b) Calculate the magnitude the electric field in terms of α and the distance r from the axis of the tube for $a < r < b$.
(c) Calculate the magnitude the electric field in terms of α and the distance r from the axis of the tube for $r>b$.
>Solution
a. When $r < a$, the enclosed charge is just from the line charge. The direction of the electri field is radially outward.
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q_{encl} &= \alpha l\\
\Phi_E &= EA = E\cdot 2\pi r l = \frac{Q_{encl}}{\epsilon_0}\\
\To & E= \frac{\alpha}{2\pi r \epsilon_0}
\end{aligned}
$$
b. The charge per unit length on the inner surface of the hollow cylinder is $-\alpha$ (due to induction). When $a < r < b$, the enclosed charge is zero. Therefore, there is no electric field.
c. The same result from part b also applies when $r > b$.
