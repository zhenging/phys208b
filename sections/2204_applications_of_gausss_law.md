### 2204 Applications of Gauss's Law


#### EXAMPLE 22.6 FIELD OF A UNIFORM LINE CHARGE
Electric charge is distributed uniformly along an infinitely long, thin wire. The charge per unit length is l (assumed positive). Find the electric field by using Gauss's law.

The flux through the flat ends of our Gaussian surface is zero because the radial electric field os parallel to these ends, and so $\vec E \cdot \hat n = 0$. On the cylindrical part of our surface we have $\vec E \cdot \hat n = E_\perp = E$ everwhere. If $\lm$ were negative, we would have $\vec E \cdot \hat n = E_\perp = -E$ everwhere. The area of the cylindrical surface is $2\pi rl$, so the flux through it-and hence the total flux $\Phi_E$ through the Gaussian surface -  is $EA = 2\pi rl E$. The total enclosed charge is $Q_{encl} = \lm l$, and so from Gauss's Law, Eq. (22.8)
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Phi_E &= EA = 2\pi rl E = \frac{\lm l}{\epsilon_0}\\
\To E &= \frac{1}{2\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{\lm}{r}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### EXAMPLE 22.7 FIELD OF AN INFINITE PLANE SHEET OF CHARGE
Use Gauss's law to find the electric field caused by a thin, flat, infinite sheet with a uniform positive surface charge density $\sigma$.

>Solution
The flux through the cylindrical part of our Gaussian surface is zero because $\vec E \cdot \hat n = 0$ everywhere. The flux through each flat end of the surface is $+EA$ becaues $\vec E \cdot \hat n = E_\perp = E$ everwhere. If $\lm$ were negative, we would have $\vec E \cdot \hat n = E_\perp = -E$ everwhere, so the total flux through both ends-and hence the total flux $\Phi_E$ through the Gaussian surface -  is $+2EA$. The total enclosed charge is $Q_{encl} = \sigma A$, and so from Gauss's Law, Eq. (22.8)
$$
\begin{aligned}
2EA &= \frac{\sigma A}{\epsilon_0}\\
\To E &= \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}
\end{aligned}
$$

22.17 A very long uniform line of charge has charge per unit length 4.80 $\mu C/m$ and lies along the x-axis. A second long uniform line of charge has charge per unit length -2.40 $\mu C/m$ and is parallel to the x-axis at y = 0.400 m. What is the net electric field (magnitude and direction) at the following points on the y-axis: (a) y = 0.200 m and (b) y = 0.600 m?
