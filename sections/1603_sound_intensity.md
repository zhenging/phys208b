15, 21, 24
16.15 **Eavesdropping!** You are trying to overhear a juicy conversation, but from your distance of $15.0 \text{ m}$, it sounds like only an average whisper of $20.0 \text{ dB}$. How close should you move to the chatterboxes for the sound level to be $60.0 \text{ dB}$?

16.21 A baby’s mouth is $30 \text{ cm}$ from her father’s ear and $1.50 \text{ m}$ from her mother’s ear. What is the difference between the sound intensity levels heard by the father and by the mother?

16.24  (a) If two sounds differ by $5.00 \text{ dB}$, find the ratio of the intensity of the louder sound to that of the softer one. (b) If one sound is 100 times as intense as another, by how much do they differ in sound intensity level (in decibels)? (c) If you increase the volume of your stereo so that the intensity doubles, by how much does the sound intensity level increase?
