#### Exercises
4, 11, 14

34.4 A concave mirror has a radius of curvature of $34.0 \text{ cm}$. (a) What is its focal length? (b) If the mirror is immersed in water (refractive index $1.33$), what is its focal length?

34.11 A spherical, concave shaving mirror has a radius of curvature of $32.0 \text{ cm}$. (a) What is the magnification of a person’s face when it is $12.0 \text{ cm}$ to the left of the vertex of the mirror? (b) Where is the image? Is the image real or virtual? (c) Draw a principal-ray diagram showing the formation of the image.

34.14 For a convex spherical mirror that has focal length $f = -12.0 \text{ cm}$, what is the distance of an object from the mirror’s vertex if the height of the image is half the height of the object?
