### 3502 Two-source Interference Of Light

#### Exercises
7, 9, 12, 14, 59

(7) Youngâ€™s experiment is performed with light from excited helium atoms $\lambda = 502$ nm). Fringes are measured carefully on a screen $1.20$ m away from the double slit, and the center of the 20th fringe (not counting the central bright fringe) is found to be $10.6$ mm from the center of the central bright fringe. What is the separation of the two slits?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
d\sin \th &= m \lambda\\
m &= 20\\
\lambda &= 5.02 \times 10^{-7} \text{m}\\
\th &= \arctan (\frac{10.6 \times 10^{-3}\text{m}}{1.2\text{m}})\\
\To & d= \frac{m \lambda}{\sin \th}\\
&= 1.14 \text{mm}
\end{aligned}
$$

(9) Two slits spaced 0.450 mm apart are placed 75.0 cm from a screen. What is the distance between the second and third dark lines of the interference pattern on the screen when the slits are illuminated with coherent light with a wavelength of 500 nm?

35.59 Interference occurs with not only light waves but also all frequencies of electromagnetic waves and all other types of waves, such as sound and water waves. Suppose that your physics professor sets up two sound speakers in the front of your classroom and uses an electronic oscillator to produce sound waves of a single frequency. When she turns the oscillator on (take this to be its original setting), you and many students hear a loud tone while other students hear nothing. (The speed of sound in air is 340 m/s.) She then slowly moves one speaker away from you until it reaches a point at which you can no longer hear the tone. If she has moved the speaker by 0.34 m (farther from you), what is the frequency of the tone?
>Solution
When you no longer hear the tone, destructive interference of sound waves occurs at your point. The path difference between two sound source is $\Delta x = 0.34\text{m}$. With destructive Interference, we have
$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta x &= (m + \frac{1}{2}) \lambda \quad (m=0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \cdots)\\
\lambda &= \frac{v}{f}\\
\To f &= \frac{mv}{\Delta x} = \frac{.5 \times 340}{0.34}\\
&= 500\text{Hz} \quad(m=0)
\end{aligned}
$$
