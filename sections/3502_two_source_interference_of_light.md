### 3502 Two-source Interference Of Light

#### Exercises
7, 9, 12, 14

(7) Youngâ€™s experiment is performed with light from excited helium atoms $\lambda = 502$ nm). Fringes are measured carefully on a screen $1.20$ m away from the double slit, and the center of the 20th fringe (not counting the central bright fringe) is found to be $10.6$ mm from the center of the central bright fringe. What is the separation of the two slits?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
d\sin \th &= m \lambda\\
m &= 20\\
\lambda &= 5.02 \times 10^{-7} \text{m}\\
\th &= \arctan (\frac{10.6 \times 10^{-3}\text{m}}{1.2\text{m}})\\
\To & d= \frac{m \lambda}{\sin \th}\\
&= 1.14 \text{mm}
\end{aligned}
$$

(9) Two slits spaced $0.450$ mm apart are placed $75.0$ cm from a screen. What is the distance between the second and third dark lines of the interference pattern on the screen when the slits are illuminated with coherent light with a wavelength of $500$ nm?
