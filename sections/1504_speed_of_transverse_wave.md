15.15 One end of a horizontal rope is attached to a prong of an electrically driven tuning fork that vibrates the rope transversely at $120$ Hz. The other end passes over a pulley and supports a $1.50$-kg mass. The linear mass density of the rope is $0.0480 \text{ kg/m}$.
(a) What is the speed of a transverse wave on the rope?
(b) What is the wavelength?
(c) How would your answers to parts (a) and (b) change if the mass were increased to 3.00 kg?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}} = \sqrt{\frac{1.5 \times 9.8}{0.048}} = 17.5 \text{ m/s}\\
\lambda &= \frac{v}{f} = \frac{17.5}{120} = 0.146 \text{ m}
\end{aligned}

15.18 A 1.50-m string of weight 0.0125 N is tied to the ceiling at its upper end, and the lower end supports a weight W. Ignore the very small variation in tension along the length of the string that is produced by the weight of the string. When you pluck the string slightly, the waves traveling up the string obey the equation
$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x, t) = (8.5 \text{ mm}) \cos(172 \text{ rad/m} x - 4830 \text{ rad/s} t)
\end{aligned}
$$
Assume that the tension of the string is constant and equal to $W$.
(a) How much time does it take a pulse to travel the full length of the string?
(b) What is the weight $W$?
(c) How many wavelengths are on the string at any instant of time?
(d) What is the equation for waves traveling down the string?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
k &=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = 172 \text{ rad/m}  = 172 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ m}^{-1}\\
\To \lambda &= \frac{2\pi}{k} = \frac{2\pi}{172 \times \frac{\pi}{180}}  = 2.09 \text{ m}\\
\omega &= \frac{2\pi}{T} = 4830 \text{rad/s} = 4830 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \text{ s}^{-1}\\
\To T &= \frac{2\pi}{\omega} = \frac{2\pi}{4830 \times \frac{\pi}{180}} = 0.075 \text{ s}\\
v &= \frac{\lambda}{T} = \frac{2.09}{0.075} = 27.9 \text{ m/s}\\
\end{aligned}

15.19 A thin, 75.0-cm wire has a mass of 16.5 g. One end is tied to a nail, and the other end is attached to a screw that can be adjusted to vary the tension in the wire.
(a) To what tension (in newtons) must you adjust the screw so that a transverse wave of wavelength 3.33 cm makes 625 vibrations per second?
(b) How fast would this wave travel?
>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mu &= \frac{16.5 \text { g}}{75.0 \text{ cm}} = 0.022 \text{ kg/m}\\
\lambda &= 0.0333 \text{ m}\\
f &= 625 \text{ Hz}\\
v &= \lambda f = 0.0333 \times 625 = 20.8 \text{ m/s}\\
v &= \sqrt{\frac{F}{\mu}} \To F = v^2 \mu = 9.53 \text{ N}
\end{aligned}
