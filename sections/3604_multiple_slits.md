### 3604 Multiple Slits

#### Exercises
21a, 22

(21) An interference pattern is produced by light of wave length $580$ nm from a distant source incident on two identical parallel slits separated by a distance (between centers) of $0.530$ mm. (a) If the slits are very narrow, what would be the angular positions of the first-order and second-order, two-slit interference maxima?

(22) Laser light of wavelength $500.0$ nm illuminates two identical slits, producing an interference pattern on a screen $90.0$ cm from the slits. The bright bands are $1.00$ cm apart, and the third bright bands on either side of the central maximum are missing in the pattern. Find the width and the separation of the two slits.
