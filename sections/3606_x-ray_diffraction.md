### 3606 X-ray Diffraction
A crystal serves as a three-dimensional diffraction grating for x rays with wavelengths of the same order of magnitude as the spacing between atoms in the crystal. For a set of crystal planes spaced a distance *d* apart, constructive interference occurs when the angles of incidence and scattering (measured from the crystal planes) are equal and when the Bragg condition [Eq. (36.16)] is satisfied. (See Example 36.5.)
$$
d\sin \th = m \lambda \quad (m=1, 2, \cdots) \quad \bold{(36.16)}
