### Ch 22 Gauss's Law

#### Learning Objectives
1. Understand how Gauss Law is defined in terms of electric flux and the enclosed charge
2. Work with Gauss law to calculate the electric field for continuous charge distributions with spherical, planar, and cylindrical symmetry. Include results that work with conductors in these symmetries
