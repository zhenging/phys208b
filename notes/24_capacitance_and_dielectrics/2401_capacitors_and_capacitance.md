#### Exercises
3, 7, 8, 9, 12

24.3 A parallel-plate air capacitor of capacitance 245 pF has a charge of magnitude $0.148 \mu C$ on each plate. The plates are 0.328 mm apart. (a) What is the potential difference between the plates? (b) What is the area of each plate? (c) What is the electric-field magnitude between the plates? (d) What is the surface charge density on each plate?
