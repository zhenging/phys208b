### 2401 Capacitors and Capacitance

+ Any two conductors separated by an insulator (or a vacuum) form a **capacitor**.
+ The ratio of charge to potential difference is called the **capacitance** of the capacitor.
$$
\begin{aligned}
C = \frac{Q}{V_{ab}}
\end{aligned}
$$
$C$ - The _Capacitance_ of a capacitor.
$Q$ - Magnitude of charge on each conductor.
$V_{ab}$ - Potential difference between conductors (a has charge $+Q$, and b has charge $-Q).
+ The SI unit of capacitance is called one **farad** (1F).
$$
\begin{aligned}
1F = 1 \text{ farad} = 1 C/V = 1 \text{ coulomb/volt}
\end{aligned}
$$

24.3 A parallel-plate air capacitor of capacitance 245 pF has a charge of magnitude $0.148 \mu C$ on each plate. The plates are 0.328 mm apart. (a) What is the potential difference between the plates? (b) What is the area of each plate? (c) What is the electric-field magnitude between the plates? (d) What is the surface charge density on each plate?
