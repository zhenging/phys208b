### 2401 Capacitors and Capacitance

+ Any two conductors separated by an insulator (or a vacuum) form a **capacitor**.
+ The ratio of charge to potential difference is called the **capacitance** of the capacitor.
$$
\begin{aligned}
C = \frac{Q}{V_{ab}}
\end{aligned}
$$
$C$ - The _Capacitance_ of a capacitor.
$Q$ - Magnitude of charge on each conductor.
$V_{ab}$ - Potential difference between conductors (a has charge $+Q$, and b has charge $-Q).
+ The SI unit of capacitance is called one **farad** (1F).
$$
\begin{aligned}
1F = 1 \text{ farad} = 1 C/V = 1 \text{ coulomb/volt}
\end{aligned}
$$

24.3 A parallel-plate air capacitor of capacitance 245 pF has a charge of magnitude $0.148 \mu C$ on each plate. The plates are 0.328 mm apart. (a) What is the potential difference between the plates? (b) What is the area of each plate? (c) What is the electric-field magnitude between the plates? (d) What is the surface charge density on each plate?
>Solution
The capacitance is $C = 2.45 \times 10^{-10} F$.
The magnitude of charge is $Q = 1.48 \times 10^{-7} C$.
The distance between the plates is $d = 3.28 \times 10^{-4} m$.
a. The potential difference is
$$
V _{ab}= \frac{Q}{C} = \frac{1.48 \times 10^{-7}}{2.45 \times 10^{-10}} = 604.1V
$$
b. The area of each plate
$$
\begin{aligned}
C &= \epsilon_0\frac{A}{d} \\
\To A &= \frac{Cd}{\epsilon_0} = \frac{2.45 \times 10^{-10} \times 3.28 \times 10^{-4}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12}}\\
&= 9.08 \times 10^{-3} m^2
\end{aligned}
$$
c. The electric field between the plates
$$
\begin{aligned}
E &= \frac{Q}{\epsilon_0 A} = \frac{1.48 \times 10^{-7}}{8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times 9.08 \times 10^{-3}}\\
&= 1.84 \times 10^6 N/m
\end{aligned}
$$
d. The surface charge density
$$
\begin{aligned}
\lm &= \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{1.48 \times 10^{-7}}{9.08 \times 10^{-3}} = 1.63 \times 10^{-5} C/m^2
\end{aligned}
$$
