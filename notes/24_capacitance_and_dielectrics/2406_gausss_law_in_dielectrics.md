### 2406 Gauss's Law in Didelectrics


#### Exercises
43

**24.43** A parallel-plate capacitor has the volume between its plates filled with plastic with dielectric constant $K$. The magnitude of the charge on each plate is $Q$. Each plate has area $A$, and the distance between the plates is $d$. (a) Use Gaussâ€™s law as stated in Eq. (24.23) to calculate the magnitude of the electric field in the dielectric. (b) Use the electric field determined in part (a) to calculate the potential difference between the two plates. (c) Use the result of part (b) to determine the capacitance of the capacitor. Compare your result to Eq. (24.12).
