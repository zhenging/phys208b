**25.7** The current in a wire varies with time according to the relationship $I = 55 A - (0.65 A/s^2 ) t^2$. (a) How many coulombs of charge pass a cross section of the wire in the time interval between t = 0 and t = 8.0 s? (b) What constant current would transport the same charge in the same time interval?
>Solution
a. The total charge is
$$
\begin{aligned}
q &= \int_0^{8.0} Idt\\
&= (55t - \frac{0.65}{3}t^3) \vert_0^{8.0}\\
&= 329.1 C
\end{aligned}
$$
b. The constant current that would transport the same charge in the same time interval is
$$
\begin{aligned}
I & =\frac{q}{t} = \frac{329.1}{8} = 41.1 A
\end{aligned}
$$

**25.8** Current passes through a solution of sodium chloride. In 1.00 s, $2.68 \times 10^{16}$ Na+ ions arrive at the negative electrode and $3.92 \times 10^{16}$ Cl- ions arrive at the positive electrode. (a) What is the current passing between the electrodes? (b) What is the direction of the current?
>Solution
a. The charge on a proton or an electron is $1.6 \times 10^{-19}C$. The total charge can be calculated by
$$
\begin{aligned}
Q &= (2.68 \times 10^{16} + 3.92 \times 10^{16}) \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19}C\\
&= 1.056 \times 10^{-2}C
\end{aligned}
$$
The formular for current is
$$
\begin{aligned}
I &= \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{1.056 \times 10^{-2}C}{1.00s}\\
&= 1.056 \times 10^{-2} A
\end{aligned}
$$
b. The direction of the current is from positive electrode to negative electrode.
