#### Exercises
30, 31, 34, 37

23.30 An infinitely long line of charge has linear charge den­sity $5.00 \times 10^{-12}$ C/m. A proton (mass $1.67 \times 10^{-27}$ kg, charge $+ 1.60 \times 10^{-19}C$) is 18.0 cm from the line and moving directly toward the line at $3.50 \times 10^3$ m/s.
(a) Calculate the proton’s initial kinetic energy.
(b) How close does the proton get to the line of charge?
