#### Exercises
15, 17, 21

33.15 **Light Pipe**. Light enters a solid pipe made of plastic having an index of refraction of $1.60$. The light travels parallel to the upper part of the pipe (Fig. E33.15). You want to cut the face AB so that all the light will reflect back into the pipe after it first strikes that face.
(a) What is the largest that u can be if the pipe is in air?
(b) If the pipe is immersed in water of refractive index $1.33$, what is the largest that $\mu$ can be?

33.17 The critical angle for total internal reflection at a liquidâ€“ air interface is $42.5\degree$. (a) If a ray of light traveling in the liquid has an angle of incidence at the interface of $35.0\degree$, what angle does the refracted ray in the air make with the normal? (b) If a ray of light traveling in air has an angle of incidence at the interface of $35.0\degree$, what angle does the refracted ray in the liquid make with the normal?

33.21 Light is incident along the normal on face AB of a glass prism of refractive index $1.52$, as shown in Fig. E33.21. Find the largest value the angle a can have without any light refracted out of the prism at face AC if (a) the prism is immersed in air and (b) the prism is immersed in water.


#### Quiz
(12) The critial angle at an air, glass interface is $42\degree$. Calculate the angle of refraction into air if the incident angle is $30\degree$. ($n_{air} = 1$)
>Solution
$48.4\degree$
