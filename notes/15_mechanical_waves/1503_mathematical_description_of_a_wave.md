### 1503 Mathematical Description of a Wave

#### Wave Function
Waves on a string are transverse; during wave motion a particle with equilirum position $x$ is displaced some distance $y$ in the direction perpendicular to the x-axis. The value of $y$ depends on which particle we are takling about ($x$), and also on the time $t$. Thus $y$ is a function of both $x$ and $t$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
y = y(x, t)
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Wave Function for a Sinusoidal Wave
Suppose that the displacement of a particle at the left end of the string ($x=0$), where the wave originates, is given by
$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x=0, t) = A\cos(\omega t) = A \cos(2\pi f t) \quad \bold{(15.2)}
\end{aligned}
$$
The wave disturbance traves from $x=0$ to some point x to the right of the origin in an mount of time given by $\dfrac{x}{v}$, where $v$ is the wave speed. So the motion of point $x$ at time $t$ is the same at the motion of point $x=0$ at the earlier time $(t-\dfrac{x}{v})$. Hence we can find the displacement of point $x$ at time $t$ by simpley replacing $t$ in Eq. (15.2) by $(t-\dfrac{x}{v})$.
$$
y(x, t) = A\cos\lb \omega (t - \frac{x}{v})\rb
$$
Because $\cos \th = \cos(-\th)$, we can rewrite the wave function as
$$
y(x, t) = A\cos\lb \omega (\frac{x}{v} - t)\rb \quad \bold{(15.3)}
$$
Express Eq. (15.3) in terms of period $T=1/f$ and the wavenlength $\lambda = v/f = \dfrac{2\pi v}{\omega}$:
$$
y(x, t) = A\cos\lb 2\pi (\frac{x}{\lambda} - \frac{t}{T})\rb \quad \bold{(15.4)}
$$

Let $k = \dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ (called **wave number**), we have $\lambda = 2\pi k$. We can then rewrite Eq. (15.4) as
$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x, t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t)
\end{aligned} \quad \bold{(15.7)}
$$

#### More on the Wave Function
For a wave travelling in the **negative** x-direction,
$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x, t) = A\cos\lb \omega (\frac{x}{v} + t)\rb =  A\cos\lb 2\pi (\frac{x}{\lambda} + \frac{t}{T})\rb = A\cos(kx + \omega t) \quad \bold{(15.8)}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### Particial Velocity and Acceleration in a Sinusoidal Wave
From the wave equation we can get an expression for the transverse velocity of any particle in a transverse wave. We can this $v_y$ to distinguish it from the wave propagation speed $v$. To find the transverse velocity $v_y$ at a particular point $x$, we take the derivative of wave function $y(x, t)$ with respect to $t$, keeping $x$ constant. If the wave function is
$$
y(x, t) = A\cos(kx - \omega t)
$$
then
$$
v_y(x, t) = \frac{\partial y(x, t)}{\partial t} = \omega A \sin(kx - \omega t) \quad \bold{(15.9)}
$$
Equation (15.9) shows that the transverse velocity of a particle varies with time, as we expect for SHM. The maximum particle speed is $\omega A$; this can be greater than, less, or equal to the wave speed $v$, depending on the amplitude and frequency of the wave.
The acceleration of any particle is the second partial derivative of $y(x, t)$ with respect to $t$
$$
\begin{aligned}
a_y(x, t) = \frac{\partial^2 y(x, y)}{\partial t^2} &=-\omega^2 A \cos(kx - \omega t)\\
&= -\omega^2 y(x, t) &\bold{(15.10)}
\end{aligned}
$$
We can also compute partial derivative of $y(x, t)$ with respect to $x$, holding $t$ constant. The first derivative $\frac{\partial y(x, t)}{\partial x}$ is the slope of the string at point $x$ and at time $t$. The second partial derivative with respect to $x$ tells us the curvature of the string.
$$
\frac{\partial^2 y(x, y)}{\partial x^2} = -k^2 A \cos(kx - \omega t) = -k^2 y(x, t) \quad\bold{(15.11)}
$$
From Eqs. (15.10) and (15.11) and the relationship $\omega  = vk$ we see that
$$
\frac{\partial^2 y(x, t) / \partial t^2}{\partial^2 y(x, t) / \partial x^2} = \frac{\omega^2}{k^2} = v^2
$$
and
$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{\partial^2 y(x, t)}{\partial x^2} = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial^2 y(x, t)}{\partial t^2} \quad \bold{(15.12)}
\end{aligned}
$$

15.7 Transverse waves on a string have wave speed $8.00$ m/s, amplitude $0.0700$ m, and wavelength 0.320 m. The waves travel in the −x-direction, and at $t = 0$ the $x = 0$ end of the string has its maximum upward displacement.
(a) Find the frequency, period, and wave number of these waves.
(b) Write a wave function describing the wave.
(c) Find the transverse displacement of a particle at $x = 0.360$ m at time $t = 0.150$ s.
(d) How much time must elapse from the instant in part (c) until the particle at x = 0.360 m next has maximum upward displacement?
>Solution
a. Frequency $f = \dfrac{v}{\lambda} = \dfrac{8}{0.32} = 25 \text{Hz}$
Period $T = \dfrac{1}{f} = 0.04s$
Wave number $k = \dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda} = \dfrac{2\pi}{0.32} = 6.25 \pi \text{ rad/m}$
b. Waven function. (negative x-axis)
$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x, t) &= A \cos(kx + \omega t)\\
&= 0.07 \cos(6.25 \pi x + 2\pi \times 25 t)\\
&= 0.07 \cos(6.25 \pi x + 50\pi t)
\end{aligned}
$$
c. $x = 0.360$ m at time $t = 0.150$ s
$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x, t) &= 0.07 \cos(6.25 \pi \times 0.36 + 50\pi \times 0.15)\\
&= 0.0495 \text{ m}
\end{aligned}
$$
d. $y = 0.07 \text{m}, x=0.360 \text{ m}$
$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x, t) &= 0.07 \cos(6.25 \pi x + 50\pi t)\\
0.07 &= 0.07 \cos(6.25 \pi \times 0.36 + 50 \pi t)\\
\To t &= 0.035 + nT\text{ s}\\
t &\gt 0.15\\
\To &n > 2.875 \\
\Delta t &= 0.035 + 3 \times 0.04 - 0.15 = 0.005 \text{s}
\end{aligned}
$$
The moment $y$ has the maximum upward displacement after $t=0.15 \text{s}$ is when $n = 3$, and the time elapsed is $0.005$ s.

Frequency, $f = \dfrac{1}{T} = \dfrac{1}{0.036 \text{ s}} = 27.8 \text{ Hz}$

$a$ and $b$ are wave equations.
$$
\begin{aligned}
v_y(x, t) &= \frac{\partial y(x, t)}{\partial t} = \omega A\cos(kx + \omega t)\\
a_y(x, t) &= \frac{\partial^2 y(x, t)}{\partial t^2} = -\omega^2 A\sin(kx + \omega t)
\end{aligned}
$$

>Solution
$$
\begin{aligned}
\omega &= 6.20 \text{ rad/s} = 6.20 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \text{s}^{-1}\\
T  &= \dfrac{2\pi}{\omega} = \dfrac{2\pi}{ 6.2 \times \frac{\pi}{180}} = 58.1 \text{ s}\\
k = & 0.410 \text{ rad/cm} = 41 \times \frac{\pi}{180} \text{m}^{-1}\\
\lambda &= \dfrac{2\pi}{k} = \dfrac{2\pi}{41 \times \frac{\pi}{180}} = 8.78 \text{ m}\\
f &= \frac{1}{T} = 0.0172 \text{ Hz}\\
v &= \lambda f = 8.78 \times 0.0172 = 0.15m/s
\end{aligned}
$$

15.11 A sinusoidal wave is propagating along a stretched string that lies along the x-axis. The displacement of the string as a function of time is graphed in Fig. E15.11 for particles at $x=0$ and $x=0.0900$ m.
(a) What is the amplitude of the wave?
(b) What is the period of the wave?
(c) You are told that the two points x = 0 and x = 0.0900 m are within one wavelength of each other. If the wave is moving in the + xdirection, determine the wavelength and the wave speed.
(d) If instead the wave is moving in the - x-direction, determine the wavelength and the wave speed.
(e) Would it be possible to determine definitively the wavelengths in parts (c) and (d) if you were not told that the two points were within one wavelength of each other? Why or why not?
![Graph](../assets/15_11.png)
>Solution
Amplitude $A = 4 \text{ mm}$, Period $T = 0.04s$
c. When the wave travels in the positive x-axis, the time elasped from $x=0$ to $x=0.09$ is $\Delta t=0.035-0.01 = 0.025s$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.09}{0.025} = 3.6 \text{ m/s}\\
\lambda &= vT = 3.6 \times 0.04 = 0.144 \text{ m}
\end{aligned}
$$
d. When the wave travels in the negative x-axis, the time elasped from $x=0$ to $x=0.09$ is $\Delta t=0.05 - 0.035 = 0.015s$.
$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{0.09}{0.015} = 6 \text{ m/s}\\
\lambda &= vT = 6 \times 0.04 = 0.24 \text{ m}
\end{aligned}
$$
e. It is impossible. The possibility of the number of waves between these two points is infinite.

y(x, t) &= A\cos\lb \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} (x - vt)\rb\\
\end{aligned}
$$
b. Let $k=\dfrac{2\pi}{\lambda}, \omega = 2\pi f$,
$$
\begin{aligned}
y(x, t) &= A\cos\lb \omega (\frac{x}{v} - t)\rb\\
&= A\cos(kx - \omega t)\\
v_y(x, t) &= \frac{\partial y(x, t)}{\partial t} =\omega A\sin(kx - \omega t)
\end{aligned}
$$
c.
$$
\begin{aligned}
v &= \lambda f\\
v_{ymax} &= \omega A = 2\pi f A\\
v_{ymax} &\gt v \To A \gt \frac{\lambda}{2\pi}\\

\end{aligned}
$$
