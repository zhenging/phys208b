#### Exercises
36, 38, 40, 42

15.36 Adjacent antinodes of a standing wave on a string are $15.0 \text{ cm}$ apart. A particle at an antinode oscillates in simple harmonic motion with amplitude $0.850 \text{ cm}$ and period $0.0750 \text{ s}$. The string lies along the +x-axis and is fixed at $x = 0$.
(a) How far apart are the adjacent nodes?
(b) What are the wavelength, amplitude, and speed of the two traveling waves that form this pattern?
(c) Find the maximum and minimum transverse speeds of a point at an antinode.
(d) What is the shortest distance along the string between a node and an antinode?
>Solution
a. Thd distance between two adjacent nodes is $15.0 \text{ cm}$.
b. Wavelength $\lambda = 0.15 \times 2 = 0.3 \text{ m}$, amplitude $A = 0.85 \times 10^{-2} \text{ m}$
c. **Todo**
d. The shortest distance between a node and an antinode is $\frac{0.15}{2} = 0.075 \text{ m}$.

15.38  A $1.50$-m-long rope is stretched between two supports with a tension that makes the speed of transverse waves $62.0 \text{ m/s}$. What are the wavelength and frequency of (a) the fundamental; (b) the second overtone; (c) the fourth harmonic?
>Solution
a. Fundamental
$$
\begin{aligned}
n &= 1, \lambda = \frac{2L}{n} = \frac{2\times 1.5}{1} = 3\text{ m}\\
f &= \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{62}{3} = 20.67 \text{ Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$
b. The second overtone
$$
\begin{aligned}
n &= 3, \lambda = \frac{2L}{3} = \frac{2\times 1.5}{3} = 1\text{ m}\\
f &= \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{62}{1} = 60 \text{ Hz}
\end{aligned}
$$
c. The fourth overtone
$$
\begin{aligned}
n &= 4, \lambda = \frac{2L}{4} = \frac{2\times 1.5}{4} = 0.75\text{ m}\\
f &= \frac{v}{\lambda} = \frac{62}{0.75} = 82.67 \text{ Hz}
\end{aligned}
