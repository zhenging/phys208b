### 3305 Polarization

The direction of polarization of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave is the direction of the $\vec{E}$ field. A polarizing filter passes waves that are linearly polarized along its polarizing axis and blocks waves polarized perpendicularl to that axis. When polarized light of intensity $I_{max}$ is incident on a polarizing filter used as an analyzer, the intensity $I$ of the light transmitted through the analyzer depends on the angle $\phi$ between the polarization direction of the incident light and the polarizing axis of the analyzer.

##### Malus's Law
$$
\begin{aligned}
I = I_{max} \cos^2 \phi
\end{aligned}
$$
